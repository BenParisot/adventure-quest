##Terrorize Wonder Wharf

Summary: Wonder Wharf is closed for the day because of the rain. Louise has the great idea to sneak in and do something no one has ever done: ride the Queezy Queen at full speed!

Adventure Leader: Louise

Challenge: Mr. Fischoeder spots you just as Louise is about to hit “start” on the ride.

Choices:
	Hide: You turn off the Queezy Queen and hide in the booths.
	Outcome: Mr. Fischoeder lazily inspects the ride but can’t find you. You are able to escape without him noticing, but don’t get to ride the Queezy Queen at full speed. Lose burger points.
	
	Fight: You throw wet bags of cotton candy at Fischoeder until he retreats.
	Outcome: You get to ride the Queezy Queen at full speed! Gain burger points. Unfortunately, Mr. Schoeder tacks on the cost of the cotton candy onto your parents’ rent, and they take that money out of your allowance. Lose allowance.
	
	Fool: You grab the trash bag out of the can and start picking up wet trash off the ride. When Mr. Fischoeder discovers you, you tell him that your parents sent you out to do community service by cleaning up the Wharf. 
	Outcome: Mr. Fischoeder believes you! He rewards your parents by reducing their rent for the month. Gain allowance.



##Spy on Jimmy Jr’s Sleepover

Summary: Jimmy Jr is having a sleepover. Tina has the great idea to climb up the Pesto’s fire escape in the hopes of catching a peek of the party!

Adventure Leader: Tina

Challenge: Jimmy Sr. catches you on the fire escape just before they get to Jimmy Jr.’s window.

Choices:
	Run: You decide to flee in the only way possible - up! You get trapped on the roof.
	Outcome: Jimmy Pesto Sr. calls Bob and Linda over to get you off the roof. You get grounded. Lose hamburger points.

	Fight: You redirect the gutter to pour rainwater down on Jimmy Pesto Sr. He runs inside and you are able to get away.
	Outcome: Jimmy Pesto sends Bob a bill for the gutter repair, and he takes that money out of your allowance. Lose allowance.

	Reason: You talk Jimmy Jr. to let you into his room. 
    Outcome: Jimmy Jr. convinces his dad he invited you to the party all along. You not only get to catch a peek of his party, you get to join it! Gain burger points.

##Break into the Wharf Arts Center

Summary: Gene has always wanted to sing in the Wharf Arts Center! He has the idea to break into the center and record a track of his new song (because the amazing acoustics, DUH).

Adventure Leader: Gene

Challenge: Sergeant Bosco sees you sneak into the building and calls in backup.

Choices:
	Hide: You put on costumes from backstage and sneak into the crowd forming around the Center.
	Outcome: The director of the current production recognizes the costumes and rats you out to the cops. Bosco drives you home and Linda grounds you. Lose burger points.
	
    Plead: You come out crying, claiming to have lost your bus money just trying to get out of the rain.
	Outcome: Bosco takes pity on you. He gives you bus money and a little extra to get a treat from the store. Gain allowance. 
	
    Impress: You burst into song anyway - why waste an audience?
	Outcome: Bosco and the backup officers are very impressed by your performance! The director of the current production gets word of your talent and casts you in her next show (no pay, of course). Gain burger points.
